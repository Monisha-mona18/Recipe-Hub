# Recipe-Hub

Recipe Hub App 
Project Overview: 
Recipe Hub is an easy-to-use mobile application that makes cooking easier. Recipe Hub is designed to 
help both new and master cooks find, save, and share their favorite recipes. The application 
emphasizes a simple, user-friendly interface that makes organizing recipes and discovering new foods 
easy. It has a responsive interface that makes it easy for mobile users to use and guarantees a positive 
experience. 

Key Features: 
1. Recipe Discovery and Search: 
Users can search for recipes by typing the name of the recipe. The search function filters 
results in real-time to help users find exactly what theyâ€™re looking for. 
2. Categories: 
Recipes are categorized by food type (ex: Beef, chicken, Dessert, Lamb) to make it easy to 
browse based on preferences. 
3. Ingredient List and Instructions: 
Each recipe includes a detailed ingredient list and step-by-step instructions, designed to be 
easy to follow. Ingredients are listed with the amount or volume of each item to added in the 
recipe. 
4. Favorites: 
Users can save recipes to personal collections, such as "Favorites" allowing for easy access to 
go-to dishes. 
5. YouTube Link: I have also added a YouTube link for each of the recipe to know in detailed of 
the recipe 
# For now, these are the key features that I would like to implement in my app and I will try to 
add more features later on if possible.
